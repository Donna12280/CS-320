# Software Testing and Quality Assurance Portfolio

This repository contains my work on the **ContactService**, **TaskService**, and **AppointmentService** classes. It showcases my ability to apply **unit testing** and **quality assurance techniques** to ensure functionality and reliability in software.

##  Artifacts
- **Contact.java, ContactService.java, ContactTest.java, ContactServiceTest.java**: Code implementation of contact management functionality and corresponding tests.
- **Summary and Reflections Report**: A detailed reflection on my approach to software testing, the techniques I employed, and the lessons learned during the project.

##  Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I employ **unit testing** to verify that each component works as expected and include edge case scenarios to uncover potential issues. To ensure security, I validate user input for constraints (e.g., checking phone numbers and contact IDs) and handle exceptions to avoid unexpected failures.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by analyzing the functional requirements of the software. For this project, the main focus was on contact management, so I ensured the contact information could be added, updated, and deleted with validation. This aligned with user expectations for accuracy and data integrity.

### How do I approach designing software?
I focus on designing software in a **modular** and **testable** way. I ensure that each component has a **single responsibility** and can be easily tested in isolation. This helps keep the code maintainable and reduces technical debt.
